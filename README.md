# Checking Your Python (Anaconda) Installation

## Summary of steps to complete (See corresponding sections below.)

- [ ] Fork this repository so you have your own copy to work on.
- [ ] Clone the repository on your local machine. 
- [ ] Check your version of Python using an Anaconda Prompt and a regular Command Prompt
- [ ] Edit this README.md file on your machine.
- [ ] Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- [ ] Submit a link to this GitHub repository in Canvas.

## 1. Fork & Clone

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/N6806_Fall2020_DevNotes/blob/master/Projects/002%20-%20Practice%20Using%20Git%20and%20GitHub/README.md

## Edit your README.md file

* In an editor of your choice (i.e. VSCode) edit this README.md file to add the answers requested in the tables.

## Check version

* [ ] Open an Anaconda Prompt.
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.
* [ ] Open a regular Command Prompt.
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.

|   Command   |         Result          |
|     ---     |           ---           |
|`python --version` in Anaconda Prompt         |(enter result here)|
|`python --version` in regular Command Prompt  |(enter result here)|

* If you didn't get a result in the regular command prompt, it means Python didn't get added to your path variable.
* It's not strictly necessary. It just means you should run Python from the CLI using Anaconda Prompt instead of a regular command prompt. Or you need to add the path to Python to your path variable.

## Find your path to Python interpreter

* Instruction on how to find the path to the Python interpreter in Anaconda can be found here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-path/
